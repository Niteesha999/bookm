Here’s a complete and concise closing comment that includes development opportunities for the year ahead:


---

I demonstrated Barclays' values and mindset this year by driving process automation, enhancing data accuracy, and supporting inclusion through active involvement in the EmpowerHer LeanIn Circle. My efforts were recognized through Social Recognition for earning a Digital Credentials skills badge and Thank You with Points for topping the Technology Learning Challenge at Whippany, reflecting my commitment to continuous improvement and excellence.

Looking ahead, I aim to enhance my skills in cloud technologies, focusing on AWS to support the cloud archival project. I also plan to deepen my knowledge in advanced data analytics and automation to further improve operational efficiency. Additionally, I aspire to take on more leadership roles within inclusion initiatives, contributing positively to a diverse and supportive workplace culture.
