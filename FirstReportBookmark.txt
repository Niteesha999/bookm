Progress Report on Bookmark Task
Overview
My goal for this project is to create a bookmark functionality within our Qlik environment, where user-selected options from dropdown lists can be saved, edited, and deleted, with all interactions being recorded in an SQL database. This functionality includes capturing user-specific information and maintaining timestamps in the EST timezone.

Achievements to Date
Initial Setup and Environment Configuration:

Python and Flask Setup: I set up a Flask application to serve as the backend, facilitating communication between our Qlik front end and the SQL database. This setup included installing necessary libraries and configuring the Flask environment.
Database Connection: I configured the Flask application to connect to the SQL Server using Windows Authentication via pyodbc. This involved creating a trusted connection string to ensure secure communication with the database.
Database Schema and Table Modifications:

Bookmarks Table: I created a Bookmarks table in the SQL database to store bookmark details such as bookmark name, client, product, and client segment. This table serves as the primary storage for all bookmark-related data.
Additional Columns: Added columns created_on, created_by, updated_on, and updated_by to the Bookmarks table to capture metadata about the creation and modification of bookmarks. This allows for detailed tracking of user interactions and changes over time.
Timezone Handling: Incorporated the pytz library to ensure timestamps are stored in EST. This involved modifying the backend code to convert all timestamps to EST before storing them in the database.
Backend API Endpoints:

Save Bookmark: Implemented an endpoint to save new bookmarks. This endpoint captures the user who created the bookmark and the current EST timestamp. It ensures that all relevant bookmark details are stored accurately.
Update Bookmark: Developed an endpoint to update existing bookmarks. This endpoint records the user who made the update and the updated timestamp. It ensures that any modifications to bookmarks are tracked and stored.
Delete Bookmark: Created an endpoint to delete bookmarks. This functionality allows users to remove bookmarks from the database.
Retrieve Bookmarks: Implemented an endpoint to fetch all saved bookmarks from the database for display. This endpoint ensures that users can view their saved bookmarks at any time.
Frontend Integration:

Dropdown Lists: Populated the client, product, and client segment dropdown lists dynamically from Qlik. This involved writing JavaScript code to fetch data from Qlik and populate the dropdowns accordingly.
Save Functionality: Enabled users to save their selected options as bookmarks. This functionality is integrated with the backend save endpoint.
Edit Functionality: Allowed users to edit existing bookmarks, with selected options correctly reflected in the dropdown lists and under them with cross marks for easy removal. This ensures that users can update their bookmarks seamlessly.
Delete Functionality: Provided a way for users to delete bookmarks. This functionality is integrated with the backend delete endpoint.
Search Functionality: Added search boxes to filter options in the dropdown lists, enhancing user experience. This makes it easier for users to find specific options without scrolling through long lists.
User Interface Enhancements:

Design Consistency: Ensured the UI elements like buttons, modals, and dropdowns are consistent with the overall design. This involved customizing the CSS to match the existing design language.
Cross Marks for Selected Items: Implemented cross marks for each selected item under the dropdown lists to allow easy deselection. This provides a clear and intuitive way for users to manage their selections.
Challenges and Resolutions
Pytz Installation: I faced issues with installing the pytz library due to connection timeouts. To resolve this, I used alternative installation methods, including downloading the package manually and installing it.
Timezone Handling: Successfully ensured that all timestamps (created and updated) are captured in EST by integrating pytz and modifying the backend code accordingly.
Dropdown Synchronization: Initially, there were issues where selected items were not correctly displayed under the clientSegment dropdown with cross marks. This was resolved by ensuring the updateSelectedList function was correctly called and configured.
Next Steps
Finalize Bookmark Task:

Ensure complete integration and testing of all functionalities, including save, update, and delete operations.
Verify data consistency and UI responsiveness across different browsers and devices.
Additional Features and Enhancements:

Explore additional functionalities like sorting and categorizing bookmarks for better organization.
Enhance error handling and user feedback mechanisms to improve user experience.
Deployment and User Testing:

Deploy the solution in a test environment to ensure it works as expected under real-world conditions.
Conduct user acceptance testing to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments based on user input.
Conclusion
I have made significant progress in developing the bookmark functionality, integrating it seamlessly with our Qlik environment and SQL database. The project is on track, with major functionalities implemented and tested. My focus now shifts to finalizing the remaining tasks, ensuring robustness, and preparing for deployment and user testing.
