**Subject:** Seeking Guidance and Support

Dear Meg,

I hope you're doing well. It was great meeting you at the event yesterday, and I appreciate you taking the time to listen to my concerns.

As we discussed, I’ve been in the company since February and was initially told that I would be working temporarily with a neighboring team on the TTT task until my actual project begins. While my actual manager used to check in regularly, he's become increasingly busy, which has left me feeling somewhat isolated in my current role.

The real challenge, however, has been the lack of guidance and support from the neighboring team's manager. I’ve been trying to teach myself as much as possible, but even after five months, I still find myself confused and unsure about my tasks. This has been quite frustrating, and I feel like I’m not able to contribute as effectively as I would like.

My actual manager is currently out of the office and is expected to return next week. I’m hoping to have a conversation with him to see if we can get things back on track. However, if things don’t improve, I would really appreciate your help in resolving this situation.

Thank you so much for your support and understanding. I look forward to your guidance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
