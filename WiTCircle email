Dear Future Me
Description:
Participants write a letter to their future selves, describing their goals, aspirations, and the steps they will take to overcome imposter syndrome. Encourage them to be specific and positive. These letters can be sealed and collected, then returned to participants at a future session or a year later to see how far they've come.

Example:
"Dear Future Me, I hope you have continued to trust in your abilities and have achieved the promotion you deserve. Remember, you are capable of great things."
