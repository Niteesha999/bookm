Imposter Syndrome Jar
Description:
Set up a jar labeled "Imposter Syndrome Jar" and provide slips of paper and pens. Throughout the session, participants write down any imposter thoughts they have and place them in the jar. At the end of the session, read some of the slips out loud (anonymously) and discuss them as a group, offering supportive responses and strategies for countering these thoughts.

Example:
A slip might say, "I feel like I don't deserve my promotion," and the group can discuss ways to address and counter this feeling.
