Affirmation Wall
Description:
Set up a blank wall or a large poster board as the "Affirmation Wall." Provide sticky notes and markers for participants to write down positive affirmations and encouraging messages. These can be things like "You are capable," "Believe in your abilities," or "Your achievements are deserved." Participants then stick their notes on the wall. This creates a visual display of support and encouragement.

Examples of Affirmations:

"I am enough."
"My work has value."
"I am confident and capable."
