Does AWS SCT Make Netezza Queries Compatible with Athena?
Partially. AWS SCT can help convert some queries, but it has limitations:
1.	What AWS SCT Can Do:
o	Converts Netezza SQL queries into a compatible format for Athena's Presto SQL.
o	Automatically maps compatible functions like SUBSTR → SUBSTRING, NVL → COALESCE.
o	Converts basic query structures (SELECT statements, JOINs, etc.) and rewrites them using Athena-compatible syntax.
2.	What AWS SCT Cannot Do:
o	Handle unsupported or complex Netezza functions (e.g., certain analytical or proprietary functions).
o	Convert application-specific logic written in SQL scripts.
o	Fully automate the conversion of large or highly customized queries. Some queries might require manual adjustments after conversion.

How to Handle Netezza Queries for Athena Compatibility
1.	Use AWS SCT as a Starting Point:
o	Run your SQL queries through AWS SCT.
o	Let SCT convert as much as it can automatically.
2.	Manually Review Incompatibilities:
o	Review any warnings or errors generated by AWS SCT.
o	Manually rewrite or adapt complex queries using Presto SQL (Athena's query engine).
3.	Handle Unsupported Functions:
o	Identify Netezza-specific functions unsupported by Athena.
o	Rewrite these using equivalent Athena/Presto SQL functions or logic.
o	For example:
	ROW_NUMBER in Netezza may require a WINDOW function in Athena.
4.	Test Converted Queries:
o	Run the converted queries on Athena using a subset of data to validate correctness and performance.

Limitations of AWS SCT for Athena
•	Athena is designed for querying data directly in S3, not for complex transactional operations.
•	AWS SCT can handle schema conversion well, but query compatibility conversion may require manual intervention for complex scenarios.
