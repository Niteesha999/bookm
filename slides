Reflection on Boundaries

Quote for Reflection:
"Daring to set boundaries is about having the courage to love ourselves, even when we risk disappointing others."
– Brené Brown

Reflection Prompt:

What boundary could you have set to prevent this feeling?
What’s one thing you’ll do differently next time?
Directions:

Slide 3: Discussion 1 – Identifying Areas for Boundaries
Identifying Boundaries

Prompt:
“One area where I need better boundaries is _____________, and I know this because _____________.”

Purpose: Encourage participants to think about areas where they struggle with boundaries (e.g., work hours, saying “no,” personal space, etc.).
Directions: Each participant fills in the blanks with their personal experience.
Reflection: Discuss patterns in the responses and identify why it’s difficult to set boundaries in these areas.
Slide 4: Activity 1 – Boundaries Word Chain
Boundaries Word Chain

Purpose:
A fast, fun, and spontaneous activity to identify areas where boundaries are often challenged.

How It Works:

The Circle Lead says “Boundaries”.
The first participant says the first word that comes to mind related to “boundaries” (e.g., “time”).
The next participant says a word related to “time” (e.g., “deadlines”).
The chain continues around the circle.
Examples of the chain:

Circle Lead: “Boundaries”
Participant 1: “Time”
Participant 2: “Deadlines”
Participant 3: “Stress”
Participant 4: “Balance”
Debrief:
After a few rounds, discuss the words that came up the most. Ask:

“What do these words tell us about where people struggle with boundaries?”
“Which of these areas can we work on as a group?”
Slide 5: Discussion 2 – Setting Courageous Boundaries
Setting Courageous Boundaries

Prompt:
“One boundary I will set moving forward is _____________, and I will hold myself accountable by _____________.”

Purpose: Encourage participants to think of a bold but achievable boundary they will commit to setting.
Directions: Each participant completes the sentence and shares their response with the group.
Reflection: Discuss ways participants can support each other in holding these boundaries and how to overcome guilt or pushback when setting them.

Key Phrases for Setting Boundaries:

“I won’t be able to take this on right now, but I can support you with…”
“I need some time to focus, so I’ll be logging off at 6 PM.”
“I appreciate you asking, but I have to prioritize another task.”
“I’m not available during that time, but I can schedule something later.”
Reflection Question:

Which of these phrases feels most useful for you?
Are there other boundary-setting phrases you already use that work well?

Slide 7: Activity 2 – The Boundary Commitment Circle
The Boundary Commitment Circle

Purpose:
To have participants make personal commitments to establish and protect their boundaries.

How It Works:

Each participant takes turns sharing a boundary they will set starting today.
Encourage them to make it specific (e.g., “I will no longer check emails after 7 PM” or “I will say 'no' to at least one request each week that isn’t a priority”).
After each person shares, the group gives a round of applause or words of encouragement.
Reflection:
Ask the group:

“What will you do when someone pushes back on this boundary?”
“How can we support each other to maintain our commitments?”
