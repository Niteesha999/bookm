Does AWS SCT Make Netezza Queries Compatible with Athena?
Partially. AWS SCT can help convert some queries, but it has limitations:
1.	What AWS SCT Can Do:
o	Converts Netezza SQL queries into a compatible format for Athena's Presto SQL.
o	Automatically maps compatible functions like SUBSTR → SUBSTRING, NVL → COALESCE.
o	Converts basic query structures (SELECT statements, JOINs, etc.) and rewrites them using Athena-compatible syntax.
2.	What AWS SCT Cannot Do:
o	Handle unsupported or complex Netezza functions (e.g., certain analytical or proprietary functions).
o	Convert application-specific logic written in SQL scripts.
o	Fully automate the conversion of large or highly customized queries. Some queries might require manual adjustments after conversion.

How to Handle Netezza Queries for Athena Compatibility
1.	Use AWS SCT as a Starting Point:
o	Run your SQL queries through AWS SCT.
o	Let SCT convert as much as it can automatically.
2.	Manually Review Incompatibilities:
o	Review any warnings or errors generated by AWS SCT.
o	Manually rewrite or adapt complex queries using Presto SQL (Athena's query engine).
3.	Handle Unsupported Functions:
o	Identify Netezza-specific functions unsupported by Athena.
o	Rewrite these using equivalent Athena/Presto SQL functions or logic.
o	For example:
	ROW_NUMBER in Netezza may require a WINDOW function in Athena.
4.	Test Converted Queries:
o	Run the converted queries on Athena using a subset of data to validate correctness and performance.

Limitations of AWS SCT for Athena
•	Athena is designed for querying data directly in S3, not for complex transactional operations.
•	AWS SCT can handle schema conversion well, but query compatibility conversion may require manual intervention for complex scenarios.

Installation process--

1. Launch AWS SCT
Open the Application:
Locate and open the AWS SCT application on your computer.
Upon launching, you'll see the main dashboard, which includes:
Menu Bar: Located at the top, providing access to various functions like creating projects, connecting to databases, and exporting results.
Project Tree: Situated on the left, displaying your projects and their components.
Main Workspace: The central area where detailed information about your projects, schemas, and conversion progress is shown.
2. Create a New Project
Initiate a New Project:

Click on File in the menu bar and select New Project.
A dialog box will appear prompting you to enter project details.
Enter Project Details:

Project Name: Provide a descriptive name for your project (e.g., "Netezza to Athena Migration").
Location: Choose a directory on your system where the project files will be stored.
Select Source and Target Databases:

Source Database Engine: Choose Netezza from the dropdown menu.
Target Database Engine: Select your desired target, such as Amazon Athena.
Finalize Project Creation:

Click OK to create the project.
The new project will now appear in the Project Tree on the left.
3. Connect to the Source Database (Netezza)
Add Source Connection:

In the Project Tree, right-click on Source and select Add Source.
A connection dialog will open.
Configure Connection Settings:

Database Engine: Ensure Netezza is selected.
Connection Name: Enter a name for this connection (e.g., "Netezza Source").
Server Name: Input the hostname or IP address of your Netezza server.
Port: Default is 5480; modify if your setup differs.
Database Name: Specify the name of the database you wish to connect to.
User Name: Enter your Netezza username.
Password: Enter your Netezza password.
Test and Save Connection:

Click Test Connection to verify connectivity.
If successful, click OK to save the connection.
4. Connect to the Target Database (Amazon Athena)
Add Target Connection:

In the Project Tree, right-click on Target and select Add Target.
A connection dialog will open.
Configure Connection Settings:

Database Engine: Select Amazon Athena.
Connection Name: Enter a name for this connection (e.g., "Athena Target").
AWS Region: Choose the region where your Athena instance is located.
Output S3 Folder: Specify the S3 bucket and folder for query results (e.g., s3://my-athena-results/).
Workgroup: Enter the Athena workgroup name (default is primary).
Test and Save Connection:

Click Test Connection to verify connectivity.
If successful, click OK to save the connection.
5. Analyze and Convert the Schema
Retrieve Source Schema:

In the Project Tree, expand the Netezza Source connection to view available schemas.
Select the schema you intend to migrate.
Create an Assessment Report:

Right-click on the selected schema and choose Create Report.
AWS SCT will analyze the schema and generate a report highlighting:
Objects that can be automatically converted.
Objects requiring manual intervention.
Review the Assessment Report:

Navigate to the Assessment Report tab in the Main Workspace.
Examine the findings to understand potential challenges in the migration process.
Convert the Schema:

Right-click on the schema and select Convert Schema.
AWS SCT will attempt to convert the source schema to be compatible with Amazon Athena.
The converted schema will appear under the Athena Target in the Project Tree.
6. Apply the Converted Schema to Amazon Athena
Save the Converted Schema:

Right-click on the converted schema under Athena Target and select Save as SQL.
Choose a location on your local machine to save the SQL file.
Deploy the Schema in Athena:

Open the Amazon Athena console in your web browser.
