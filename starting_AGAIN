Subject: Request for Guidance on Transitioning to Project/Product Management

Dear [Keerthi/Name of the Speaker],

I hope this email finds you well. I had the pleasure of attending your recent session, where you shared your journey and insights as a Project Manager. I found it incredibly inspiring and valuable, especially as someone keen on transitioning into project or product management.

Currently, I am working as a Front-End Developer, and I am deeply interested in pivoting my career toward project or product management. I was wondering if you might have some time to connect and discuss how I can begin this journey effectively. Your advice on gaining the right skills and navigating this transition would mean a lot to me.

Please let me know if we could schedule a short meeting or call at your convenience. I am happy to accommodate your schedule.

Thank you for considering my request, and I look forward to the opportunity to learn from your experience.

Best regards,
